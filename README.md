This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## FEATUREVISOR UI

This project is dedicated to the development of a user interface (UI) for a [FEATUREVISOR](https://github.com/featurevisor/featurevisor). The UI will provide an intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with the file system. All the files related to this project will be generated and stored in the following directory: app/_features. This directory will serve as the central location for all the project's resources, making it easier to manage and navigate through the project's files.
